  This is ckmame, a program to check ROM sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator (http://mame.retrogames.com).  It tells you
which ROM files are missing or have a wrong checksum, and can delete
unknown and unused files from the ROM sets, and rename or move ROM
files.

  To use it, you need
	- zlib (at least version 1.1.2)
	- libzip
	- either Berkley DB or GNU gdbm
	- optionally libxml2 (for parsing xmame -listxml output)
Please note that there might be problems with Berkeley db under Linux
-- use `./configure --without-db' if you encounter problems with it.

  You will also need a description of the ROM set you want to check.
For MAME, it can be obtained by running `mame -listxml'.

  You can find zlib at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib, gdbm at
your local GNU mirror (http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html),
libzip at http:/www.nih.at/libzip/, and libxml2 at http://xmlsoft.org/

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site

	ftp.nih.at /pub/nih/ckmame
The latest version can always be found there.

Usage:

  Use a recent MAME executable with the option `-listxml' to create
the database input file, e. g.
	xmame -listxml > db.xml

  Then start `mkmamedb db.xml', which writes to `mame.db'.  The name
of the resulting database can be changed with the -o option.

  Set the environment variables `MAMEDB' to point to the database file
mkmamedb just created, and `ROMPATH' to the directory above the one
where your ROMs reside (`/roms' will be added automatically to each
entry, just like MAME does).  If you don't set them, ckmame will use
the current directory as defaults for both.

  Then just type `ckmame', and off you go.  You should probably
redirect the output to a file, as it can get rather lengthy if your
ROMs haven't been tended very well.  Or take a look at the output of
`ckmame -h' to see some options which reduce the output.

  If you trust ckmame enough, start it with the parameter `-F' and it
will fix your roms (or at least try to).  Unrecognized files in your
rom sets will be saved in the directory `garbage' in the
roms-directory, in zip files with the name of game.

  Also included is `dumpgame', which outputs rom and sample
information for all games specified on the command line (using the
database).

  For a complete list of options, please take a look at the
man pages.
