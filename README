  This is ckmame, a program to check ROM sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator (http://mame.retrogames.com).  It tells you
which ROM files are missing or have a wrong checksum, and can delete
unknown and unused files from the ROM sets, and rename or move ROM
files.

  To use it, you need
	- zlib (at least version 1.1.2)
	- libzip
	- either Berkeley DB or GNU gdbm
	- optionally libxml2 (for parsing xmame -listxml output)
Please note that there might be problems with Berkeley db under Linux
-- use `./configure --without-db' if you encounter problems with it.

  You will also need a description of the ROM set you want to check.
For MAME, it can be obtained by running `mame -listxml'.

  You can find zlib at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib, gdbm at
your local GNU mirror (http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html),
libzip at http:/www.nih.at/libzip/, and libxml2 at http://xmlsoft.org/

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
