  This is ckmame, a program to check rom sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator.

  To use it, you need zlib (>=1.1.3) and either Berkeley db or GNU
gdbm, as well as a current output of `mame -listinfo' (which you can
also find on the distribution site).

  You can find zlib at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib, and gdbm
at your local GNU mirror (cf. http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html).

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to
the distribution site
	ftp.giga.or.at /pub/nih/ckmame
	http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ckmame
The latest version can always be found there.
