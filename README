  This is ckmame, a program to check rom sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator (http://mame.retrogames.com).  It tells you
which rom files are missing or have a wrong CRC, and can delete
unknown and unused files from the romsets (zipped only).

  To use it, you need zlib (at least version 1.1.2) and either
Berkeley db or GNU gdbm, as well as a current output of `mame
-listinfo' (which you can find at the distribution site).  Please note
that there might be problems with Berkeley db under Linux -- use
`./configure --without-db' if you encounter problems with it.

  You can find zlib at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib, and gdbm
at your local GNU mirror
(cf. http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html).

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site
	ftp.nih.at /pub/nih/ckmame
	http://www.nih.at/pub/nih/ckmame
The latest version can always be found there.

Usage:

  Use a recent MAME executable with the option `-listinfo' to create
the database input file, e. g.
	xmame -listinfo > db.txt

  Then start `mkmamedb', which reads `db.txt' (if you don't name a
different file on the command line) and writes to `mame.db', or
`mame.gdbm', depending on which database routines you are using.  The
name of the resulting database can be changed with the -o option.

  Set the environment variables `MAMEDB' to point to the database file
mkmamedb just created, and `ROMPATH' to the directory above the one
where your roms reside (`/roms' will be added automatically to each
entry, just like MAME does).  If you don't set them, ckmame will use
the current directory as defaults for both.

  Then just type `ckmame', and off you go.  You should probably
redirect the output to a file, as it can get rather lengthy if your
roms haven't been tended very well.  Or take a look at the output of
`ckmame -h' to see some options which reduce the output.

  If you trust ckmame enough, start it with the parameter `-F' and it
will fix your roms (or at least try to).  Unrecognized files in your
rom sets will be saved in the directory `garbage' in the
roms-directory, in zipfiles with the name of game.

  Also included is `dumpgame', which outputs rom and sample
information for all games specified on the command line (using the
database).

  For a complete list of options, please take a look at the
man page.
