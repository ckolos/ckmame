  This is ckmame, a program to check rom sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator (http://mame.retrogames.com).  It tells you
which rom files are missing or have a wrong CRC, and can delete
unknown and unused files from the romsets.

  To use it, you need zlib (at least version 1.1.3) and either
Berkeley db or GNU gdbm, as well as a current output of `mame
-listinfo' (which you can find at the distribution site).

  You can find zlib at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib, and gdbm
at your local GNU mirror (cf. http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html).

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to
the distribution site

The latest version can always be found there.
