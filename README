  This is ckmame, a program to check ROM sets for MAME, the Multiple
Arcade Machine Emulator (http://mame.retrogames.com).  It tells you
which ROM files are missing or have a wrong checksum, and can delete
unknown and unused files from the ROM sets, and rename or move ROM
files.

  To use it, you need
	- zlib (at least version 1.1.2)
	- libzip (at least version 0.9)
	- SQLite3
	- optionally libxml2 (for M.A.M.E. -listxml and detectors)

  For running the self-tests, you also need:
	- perl module Text::Diff

  You will also need a description of the ROM set you want to check.
For MAME, it can be obtained by running `mame -listxml'.

  You can find zlib at http://www.zlib.net/, SQLite3 at
http://www.sqlite.org/, libzip at http://www.nih.at/libzip/, and
libxml2 at http://xmlsoft.org/.
