-cd: do not print a line for each rom that is correct in sets that have nodump roms

use cases:
. child gets renamed (move zip to other zip name)

. missing rom is in a different (related or unrelated, but not parent/child) set

automatically fix superfluous zips that have been renamed
add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
integrity check: remember which disks have already been checked (only check once each)
support disks with parents

"fix" extra files by moving them to a subdir
use ROM_NOCRC for samples match quality
