tests:
* dirs in rom names
* case differences (game name / archive / rom / file in archive)
* whether ckmame can be run (incomplete runtime library path)
* extra cleanup done when all games checked
* dumpgame
* mkmamedb tests
  * two different roms with same name (error)
  * XML parsing
  * /prog from command line
  * /prog from file
  * broken input

- [bug] rom: use flag to specify whether we know the size
- [bug] dumpgame: report real database version or /ckmame key
- [bug] check if rompath/needed/extra are different
- [feature] inconsistent zip in ROM set: copy files to new zip
- [feature] dumpgame: dump samples
- [feature] export from DB to CM dat file(s)
- [feature] config file (provides defaults overridable on command line)
- [feature] cmcheck style diagnostics
- [feature] create dat file / db from zip archives
- [feature] database consistency checks during mkmamedb
  - are all roms of one set included in one other set
  - are two sets the same, just different name
- [feature] needed cleanup (automatically?)
- [feature] --cleanup-extra: remove (unnecessary?) directories
- [cleanup] rename: file is part of zip archive, rom is part of game
- [cleanup] no macros that evaluate arguments twice
	parray_get_last
	result_num_*
	rom_compare_m
	rom_compare_msc
	rom_compare_nsc
	rom_copmare_sc
	rom_num_altnames
- [cleanup] use AC_CHECK_TYPES for uint32_t

cmcheck features:
- db (dat file?) with roms we have elsewhere:
  - if correct on dvd, write "correct (on dvd)"
  - on dvd, only nameerrors: output optional
  - garbage, unused on dvd: output optional
  - use file from dvd: "is on dvd..." (-> game not "correct")
  * option to fix minor errors (name error, garbage, unused) from dvd to hd
  * option to delete files on disk that are not more correct than on dvd
  * option to provide mapping from db to path (for dvd dbs)
  + check dvd status first, if ok "correct" (garbage, unused)
  + use any files from roms/game.zip
    if unsplit ok: "correct"
    if split ok
      get files from dvd if possible
      else keep looking
  + use any files from superfluous/extra dirs

other features:
- parse_xml: set line numbers
- parse: add state checking to parse-cm.c
- parse: check for duplicate attributes
- tool for generating update sets from ckmame output and existing romset
- tool for generating update sets from two databases and existing romset
- find out why runtest is slow
- add support for native db3/db4
- add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
- mkmamedb: handle disk without md5
- mkmamedb: handle rom without crc
- mkmamedb: no error message for missing newline in last line
- mkmamedb: warn about sets without parent that use "merge"
- complete raine support (multiple archive names: archive ( name
  "64th_street" name "64street" ))
- handle two roms in one game with same size/hashes but different name
- handle (incorrect db) with two roms of the same name in one game
- option to check if no good dumps are needed elsewhere

code cleanups:
- refactor hashes_set and hashes_verify
- remove unneeded includes
- make parse_cm table driven
- split util*, funcs.h
- use return value of w_game
- fix all XXXs
