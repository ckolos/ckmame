* mkmamedb: analyze speed, make it faster

* mkmamedb: use/update .ckmame.db files

* needed/ not always deleted when empty, find out why

* some runs use roms from extra, but then mark them as "not used", find out why

* for {,p}arrays, add functions for free()ing data into initialization

* instead of looking in cloneof for roms, move all extra roms to needed

* clean up archives in .ckmame.db for manually removed dirs/zips

* fix .ckmame.db support for roms with headers: store hashes with
  detector applied in .ckmame.db (adapt:
  regress/rom-from-extra-detector.test,
  regress/rom-from-superfluous-detector.test, regress/skip-full.test,
  regress/skip.test, src/dbh_cache.c)

* uncompressed support
** [bug] existing no good rom is not accepted in uncompressed mode (nogood-diskgood.test)

* bugs with test cases
! [bug] diagnostics: -c for correct game outputs game correct + disk correct (nogood-diskgood.test)
! [bug] mkmamedb: three generation merge grandchild to child does not work (mamedb-merge-parent.dump)
+ [bug] improve zero-miss.test diagnostics when creating zero size file
+ [bug] mkmamedb: warn if rom from parent has different crc (mkmamedb-parent-crcdiff-mame.test)
+ [bug] mkmamedb: merge does not match name in parent: warning and fixup (mkmamedb-merge-wrong-name.test)
+ [bug] mkmamedb: does not warn about duplicate roms of type nodump or duplicate samples (mkmamedb-duplicate-nodump.test)
- [bug] detector bugs (detector-interaction-with-headerless.test, detector-prefer-file-with-header.test)

* unsorted
+ support ^T inside a game, not only between games (e.g. while searching extra dirs)
- mkmamedb doesn't handle chds (ignores for zipped, includes in games as rom for unzipped)
! [feature] reorder cleanup step when renaming files to remove the copies
  earlier; otherwise big renames on big sets don't work.
! [bug] cleanup reports file that were used this time as "not used"
! [bug] cleanup after using disks reports errors because disks were moved
  Example:
  ckmame: new/file.chd: cannot remove: No such file or directory
  In image new/file.chd:
  image new/file.chd: not used
+ [cleanup] get rid of global variables (mostly globals.c)
+ [feature] mkmamedb: parser for mtree files
+ [feature] server mode: tell location/mamedb of ROM sets, serves files needed by remote ckmame client
+ [cleanup] ckmame: create fixdat only when necessary
+ [bug] check/fix database error reporting (pass on sqlite3 errors)
+ [feature] get needed files directly from parent (inparent.test)
+ [feature] inconsistent zip in ROM set: copy files to new zip
+ [cleanup] merge disk_t into file_t
+ [feature] config file (provides defaults overridable on command line)
+ [feature] needed cleanup (automatically?)
+ [feature] mkmamedb: mark ROMs without checksums as nogooddump
+ [bug] mkmamedb -F dat:
  - write & unquoted (perhaps other meta characters as well)
  - write Umlaut wrong
    Entity: line 5986: parser error : Input is not proper UTF-8, indicate encoding !
    Bytes: 0x81 0x63 0x6B 0x73
                <rom name="Glï¿½cksrad.ipf" size="1049180" crc="008b8870" sha1="b1a4bba7c96ce0c2
                             ^
    Suggested solution: using iconv and LC_CTYPE, try transcribing invalid UTF-8 files to UTF-8
    if it fails or no iconv or LC_CTYPE available, replace invalid characters with '?'
- [feature] chd v5 support: maps, lzma, huffman, flac, a/v decompression

- [bug] dumpgame: report real database version for /dat key
- [bug] check if needed/extra are different
- [bug] DB export: pass all dat entries to output backend
- [bug] DB export: export detector
- [bug] diagnostics (fix?): don't process disks if checking samples
- [feature] add hash-types option to dumpgame
- [feature] mkmamedb: split to original CM dat files + detector XML on export
- [feature] when file for nogooddump rom exists, check if needed elsewhere
- [feature] mkmamedb: add XML output format
- [feature] database consistency checks during mkmamedb
  - are all roms of one set included in one other set
  - are two sets the same, just different name
- [feature] --cleanup-extra: remove (unnecessary?) directories
- [feature] support multiple -O arguments
- [compatibility] Accept CRCs of length<8 by zero-padding them (in front)
- [cleanup] review types used for length/offset (use 64bit?)
- [cleanup] use int2str/str2int
- [cleanup] refactor fixing code (one function per operation)
- [cleanup] handle archive refreshing in archive.c
- [cleanup] rename: file is part of zip archive, rom is part of game
- [cleanup] generic string <-> int mappings
- [cleanup] no macros that evaluate arguments twice

	result_num_*
	rom_compare_m

other features:
- fixdat: if only checking child, ROM missing in parent is not in fixdat
- parse: add state checking to parse-cm.c
- parse: check for duplicate attributes
- add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
- mkmamedb: handle rom without crc
- mkmamedb: handle "size 0 crc -"
- mkmamedb: no error message for missing newline in last line
- mkmamedb: warn about sets without parent that use "merge" (mamedb-merge-no-parent.dump)
- complete raine support (multiple archive names: archive ( name
  "64th_street" name "64street" ))
- handle two roms in one game with same size/hashes but different name
- option to check if no good dumps are needed elsewhere

code cleanups:
- refactor hashes_set and hashes_verify
- remove unneeded includes
- make parse_cm table driven
- split util*, funcs.h
- fix all TODOs

tests:
- extend at least following tests to use md5/sha1 as well:
  delete-used-superfluous.test
  needed-cleanup.test
  punused.test
  rom-broken-replace.test
  rom-from-extra-child.test
  rom-unused.test
  swap-roms-2.test
  rom-many.test
  swap-roms.test
- case differences (game name / archive / rom / file in archive)
- extra cleanup done when all games checked
- is superfluous file that needs detector cleaned up correctly?
- detective
- detector
  - header field
  - write to db
  - use on matching file
  - use on non-matching file
  - rule operations
  - [test] is superfluous file that needs detector cleaned up correctly?
- dumpgame
- mkmamedb tests
  - mtree output format
  - /prog from command line
  - /prog from file
  - broken input
