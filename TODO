* create .ckmame.db for extra dirs, dirs scanned by mkmamedb, unknown?
* test rom-dir: moreroms/.ckmame.db is not checked
* mkmamedb doesn't handle chds (ignores for zipped, includes in games as rom for unzipped)
* test that files with up-to-date info in .ckmame.db are not re-read (put file with different content there)
* test that files with out-of-date info is reread
* test that new files are read, old files are remove from .ckmame.db
- libzip is linked to too many executables
- add tests using pre-existing .ckmame.db, possibly out of date
- dir mode: accept files at toplevel in roms/ directory (uncompressed-toplevel-roms.test)

* previously
! [feature] reorder cleanup step when renaming files to remove the copies
  earlier; otherwise big renames on big sets don't work.
! [bug] diagnostics: -c for correct game outputs game correct + disk correct
! [bug] cleanup reports file that were used this time as "not used"
! [bug] cleanup after using disks reports errors because disks were moved
  Example:
  ckmame: new/file.chd: cannot remove: No such file or directory
  In image new/file.chd:
  image new/file.chd: not used
! [bug] mkmamedb: nogoodclone: s/romof 1-8/romof cloneof-8/ gives strange result
+ [bug] no good rom with good disk gives incorrect warnings (nogood-diskgood.test)
+ [cleanup] get rid of global variables (mostly globals.c)
+ [feature] mkmamedb: parser for mtree files
+ [feature] server mode: tell location/mamedb of ROM sets, serves files needed by remote ckmame client
+ [cleanup] ckmame: create fixdat only when necessary
+ [bug] mkmamedb: warn if rom from parent has different crc
+ [bug] mkmamedb: merge does not match name in parent: warning and fixup
+ [bug] check/fix database error reporting (pass on sqlite3 errors)
+ [feature] get needed files directly from parent (see inparent.test)
+ [feature] inconsistent zip in ROM set: copy files to new zip
+ [cleanup] merge disk_t into file_t
+ [feature] config file (provides defaults overridable on command line)
+ [feature] needed cleanup (automatically?)
+ [feature] mkmamedb: mark ROMs without checksums as nogooddump
+ [bug] mkmamedb -F dat:
  - write & unquoted (perhaps other meta characters as well)
  - write Umlaut wrong
    Entity: line 5986: parser error : Input is not proper UTF-8, indicate encoding !
    Bytes: 0x81 0x63 0x6B 0x73
                <rom name="Glï¿½cksrad.ipf" size="1049180" crc="008b8870" sha1="b1a4bba7c96ce0c2
                             ^
    Suggested solution: using iconv and LC_CTYPE, try transcribing invalid UTF-8 files to UTF-8
    if it fails or no iconv or LC_CTYPE available, replace invalid characters with '?'

- [cleanup] refactor fixing code (one function per operation)
- [cleanup] handle archive refreshing in archive.c
- [cleanup] rename: file is part of zip archive, rom is part of game
- [cleanup] generic string <-> int mappings
- [cleanup] no macros that evaluate arguments twice

	result_num_*

other features:
- parse: add state checking to parse-cm.c
- parse: check for duplicate attributes
- add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
- mkmamedb: handle rom without crc
- mkmamedb: handle "size 0 crc -"
- mkmamedb: no error message for missing newline in last line
- mkmamedb: warn about sets without parent that use "merge"
- complete raine support (multiple archive names: archive ( name
  "64th_street" name "64street" ))
- handle two roms in one game with same size/hashes but different name
- handle (incorrect db) with two roms of the same name in one game
- option to check if no good dumps are needed elsewhere

code cleanups:
- refactor hashes_set and hashes_verify
- remove unneeded includes
- make parse_cm table driven
- split util*, funcs.h
- use return value of w_game
- fix all TODOs

tests:
* finish disk-full test
* case differences (game name / archive / rom / file in archive)
* extra cleanup done when all games checked
* is superfluous file that needs detector cleaned up correctly?
* detective
* detector
  * header field
  * write to db
  * use on matching file
  * use on non-matching file

* dumpgame
* mkmamedb tests
  * mtree output format
  * two different roms with same name (error)
  * /prog from command line
  * /prog from file
  * broken input
