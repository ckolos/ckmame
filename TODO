delete used files
dumpgame -c with non-default hash type

tests:
* get rom from other game
* don't remove unneeded needed files
* don't overwrite existing needed files
- get missing roms from superfluous
- get missing roms from extra dirs
- disk renames
- get missing disks from extra dirs
* complete integrity check (not only crc) before adding file
* sample test


other:
- read games to check from file or stdin
- document comment in prototypes for function pointers
- fix, diagnostics: print match_offset properly, don't cast to int
- refactor hashes_set and hashes_verify
- make match_array_t an array_t of parray_t of match_t
- update ChangeLog
- copyright maintenance
- remove unneeded includes
- use myerror throughout
- parse_xml: set line numbers
- make parse_cm table driven
- parse: check for duplicate attributes
- check romcmp (bestbaddump)

improve output to: rom  tko-simm.05a  size 2097152  crc a275a387: SHA1 mismatch

add support for native db3/db4
add support for fname==NULL and foreach to gdbm
parse: move state handling to parse-cm.c

0.85.1: "bad dump" is reported as missing with -d
-cd: do not print a line for each rom that is correct in sets that have nodump roms

use cases:
. child gets renamed (move zip to other zip name)
. child becomes parent, parent becomes other child (move from now unknown child zip to parent)
. missing rom is in a different (related or unrelated, but not parent/child) set

automatically fix renamed disks
automatically fix superfluous zips that have been renamed
add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
integrity check: remember which disks have already been checked (only check once each)
support disks with parents
regression tests for disk: different crc types, version 2
"fix" extra files by moving them to a subdir
use ROM_NOCRC for samples match quality

mkmamedb: no error message for missing newline in last line

mkmamedb: correct inconsistencies in input db (parent not found)

fix 'should be in cloneof, is in zip'
use return value of w_game
option to force fixing parents
add error messages in ckmame with the zips (e.g. can't create file etc.)
complete raine support (multiple archive names: archive ( name "64th_street" name "64street" ))

get roms from a different location to fix sets

fix all XXXs

init rom structure for files from zips
