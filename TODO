tests:
- disk renames
- get missing disks from superfluous
- get missing disks from extra dirs
* sample test
* dumpgame
* mkmamedb tests
  * XML parsing
  * /prog from command line
  * /prog from file
  * broken input
* broken files in zip archive

- handle two roms in one game with same size/hashes but different name
- document ``checksum mismatch'' and ``broken'' diagnostics
- in check for needed elsewhere: don't check if this game needs it
- option to check if no good dumps are needed elsewhere
- don't report superfluous files that were deleted completely
- print message when executing delete_list if FIX_PRINT

other:
- read games to check from file or stdin
- document comment in prototypes for function pointers
- refactor hashes_set and hashes_verify
- update ChangeLog
- copyright maintenance
- remove unneeded includes
- parse_xml: set line numbers
- make parse_cm table driven
- parse: check for duplicate attributes
- check romcmp (bestbaddump)
- tool for generating update sets from ckmame output and existing romset
- tool for generating update sets from two databases and existing romset
- find out why runtest is slow
- split util*, funcs.h

cmcheck features:
- greppable output
- dat file with roms we have elsewhere
- create dat file

add support for native db3/db4
add support for fname==NULL and foreach to gdbm
parse: add state checking to parse-cm.c

-cd: do not print a line for each rom that is correct in sets that have nodump roms

automatically fix renamed disks
add option to check integrity for roms only (not for disks, they take forever)
integrity check: remember which disks have already been checked (only check once each)
regression tests for disk: different crc types, version 2
"fix" superfluous files by moving them to a subdir
use ROM_NOCRC for samples match quality

mkmamedb: handle disk without md5
mkmamedb: handle rom without crc
mkmamedb: no error message for missing newline in last line

use return value of w_game
option to force fixing parents
add error messages in ckmame with the zips (e.g. can't create file etc.)
complete raine support (multiple archive names: archive ( name "64th_street" name "64street" ))

get roms from a different location to fix sets

fix all XXXs

init rom structure for files from zips
support disks with parents
